## How to play

Select a category and place the phone on your forehead, so that everyone else can see the phone, but you can't.

Once the game starts, you will have one minute to guess as many words as you can. Everyone else's job is to shout clues at you about the word, trying to get you to guess it.

## Safari

On Safari, the game will be stuck on the "Loading..." screen. Click anywhere to trigger a prompt about orientation access.
